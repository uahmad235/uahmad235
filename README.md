### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am Machine Learning Engineer with more than 6 years of professional experience in the domain of AI and NLP.
- I've worked mostly on NLP and Tabular data analysis by drawing insights from both, structured and unstructured, datasets.
- I also have sound knowledge of CV & Image processing techniques.
- I have sound familarity with SOTA NLP techniques and models like the Attention-based Transformers and Sequence Modelling for solving real-world problems. 
- My experience spans over a diverse set of tasks like automation through NLP, Document Similarity, NER, Text Classification etc. 
- I enjoy exploring different areas of Machine Learning and its applications in the real-world.
- The future plan is to diversify my knowledge and experience by exploring other areas (like Speech, Computer Vision) and applying those expertise to make a difference in the world.
